/**
 * A polygonal mesh stored as a half-edge data structure.
 *
 * Each half-edge is adjacent to one face.
 * Each half-edge has a pointer to the next half-edge adjacent to the same face.
 * Each half-edge has a pointer to its opposite half-edge, unless it forms the boundary of a manifold.
 * Each half-edge has a pointer to the vertex it points to.
 * Each half-edge has a pointer to the next half-edge in the linked list of half-edges originating from the same vertex.
 * Each vertex has a pointer to the first half-edge originating from it.
 * Each face has a pointer to one of the half-edges adjacent to it.
 *
 * Note that this class stores only the topolgy of the mesh, i.e. the connectivty of vertices, half-edges
 * and faces. The embedding of the mesh into three-dimensional space, i.e. the vertex coordinates,
 * are not managed by the class and must be kept in a separate data array.
