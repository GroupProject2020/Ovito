/**
 * \brief Universal base class for most objects in OVITO.
 *
 * The OvitoObject class implements a simple reference counting mechanism to manage the
 * the lifetime of object instances. User code should make use of the OORef
 * smart-pointer class, which automatically increments and decrements the reference counter
 * of an OvitoObject when it holds a pointer to it.
 *
 * When the reference counter of an OvitoObject reaches zero, the virtual aboutToBeDeleted()
 * function is called to notify the object that is about to be deleted from memory.
 * After this function returns, the object instance destroys itself.
 *
 * The OvitoObject class provides serialization and deserialization functions, which allow
 * the object to be saved to disk and restored at a later time. Subclasses that want
 * to support serialization of their data should override the virtual functions
 * saveToStream() and loadFromStream().
