/**
 * \brief Stores the animation settings such as the animation length, current frame number, playback rate, etc.
 *
 * Each \ref Ovito::DataSet "DataSet" owns an instance of this class, which can be accessed via DataSet::animationSettings().
 *
 * OVITO measures animation time in time tick units, which correspond to 1/4800 of a second. The ::TimePoint data type, which is an alias for
 * \c int, is used to store time tick values. Conversion between time ticks and seconds is possible with the TimeToSeconds() and TimeFromSeconds()
 * global functions.
 *
 * The conversion factor from animation frames to time tick units can be changed by the user (see setTicksPerFrame()).
 * This factor determines the animation playback rate, i.e. the number of animation frames per second, which is returned by framesPerSecond().
 * Conversion between animation times and animation frames is done with the frameToTime() and timeToFrame() methods.
 *
 * The current animation time, which is controlled with the time slider in OVITO's main window, can be changed
 * with the setTime() method. The time returned by the time() method is the animation time that is currently shown in the
 * interactive viewports. Alternatively, currentFrame() and setCurrentFrame() allow to control the current animation
 * time in terms of animation frames. They internally convert from and to time tick units.
 *
 * The animation length, i.e. the time range shown in the time slider, is controlled with the animationInterval()
 * and setAnimationInterval() methods. Alternatively, setFirstFrame() and setLastFrame() allow to specify a frame-based animation
 * length.
 *
 * The automatic key-generation mode can be activated with setAutoKeyMode(). Once activated,
 * changes to animatable object parameters will automatically lead to the creation of animation keys.
 * The generation of animation keys can be temporarily suspended via suspendAnim() and resumeAnim().
